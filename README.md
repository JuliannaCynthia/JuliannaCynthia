 # Hey! âœ¨

 My name is Julianna, and I am a vocalist turned software developer.
 I currently work in Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.js, and Boostrap,
 but my current obsession is with data!
 You may reach me at ironsjulianna@gmail.com at any time, for any questions or inquiries.
 
 I've recently graduated from Tech Elevator's Full-Stack coding bootcamp, and I cannot wait to jump into
 applying my enthusiasm in more than an academic setting. Persistance and perfection will get me there!
  
## âš¡Currently, I am entombed in a Data Engineering Cert! 
 I am experiencing Python for the first time and gaining exposure to Hadoop, Hive, Spark,
 and many other services&tools!
 
### Reach out if you have any other reccomendations in services/tools/languages for a budding Data Nerd!ðŸ’¬

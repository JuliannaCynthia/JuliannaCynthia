 Hey! âœ¨

 My name is Julianna, and I am a vocalist turned software developer.
 I currently work in Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.js, and Boostrap,
 but my current obsession is with data!
 You may reach me at ironsjulianna@gmail.com at any time, for any questions or inquiries.
  
 âš¡Currently, I am entombed in a Data Engineering Cert! 
 I am experiencing Python for the first time and gaining exposure to Hadoop, Hive, Spark,
 and many other services&tools!
